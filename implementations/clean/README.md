[Clean][] is a pure and lazy functional programming language similar to [Haskell][].

To build the implementation, do the following:

1. Install Clean and the package manager Nitrile: https://clean-lang.org/about.html#install
2. Run `nitrile update`
3. In this directory, run `nitrile fetch`
4. From now on you can use `make -B _build/implementations/clean` from the root of this repository
